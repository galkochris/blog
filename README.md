<!-- This is my SPD Solo Project repository

For matters of scoping and execution, the project has changed into using Django to build a live blog site, where I can put down my thoughts on new ideas and projects. it will also be open for others to post for now, though long term I will be the only person able to post and edit, although the goal is to have users comment about posts.

For a matter of transparency, this entire project was completed during finals week, while still obtaining the end result of the intention of the project guildines: A live product that acts as a capstone on my progress from the beginning of the year. -->
